# ðŸ‡¯ðŸ‡²  Mortgage Calculator 

This mortgage calculator is a simple React app that uses TypeScript and Vite. It is a simple app that allows you to calculate your monthly mortgage payment based on the loan amount, interest rate, and loan term. <b>This calculator is specific to the Jamaican housing market.</b>

## Getting Started

To use this application you can go to the demo at 
- [insert link] 

 or :

-  run this app locally by `git clone [insert-link]`
-   `cd [link]` 
-   and then run `npm install` to install all the dependencies. 
-   Run `npm run dev` to start the development server.

## Building for Production

To build for production, run `npm run build`. This will create a `dist` folder with all the files you need to deploy to your server.

## Expanding the ESLint configuration

If you are developing a production application, we recommend updating the configuration to enable type aware lint rules:

- Configure the top-level `parserOptions` property like this:

```js
   parserOptions: {
    ecmaVersion: 'latest',
    sourceType: 'module',
    project: ['./tsconfig.json', './tsconfig.node.json'],
    tsconfigRootDir: __dirname,
   },
```

- Replace `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended` to `plugin:@typescript-eslint/recommended-type-checked` or `plugin:@typescript-eslint/strict-type-checked`
- Optionally add `plugin:@typescript-eslint/stylistic-type-checked`
- Install [eslint-plugin-react](https://github.com/jsx-eslint/eslint-plugin-react) and add `plugin:react/recommended` & `plugin:react/jsx-runtime` to the `extends` list
